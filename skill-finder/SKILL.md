# Skill Finder: Discover and Install Agent Skills from Hugging Face

## Overview

Agent skills are packaged instructions and resources hosted on Hugging Face Spaces with the `agent-skill` tag. Use the Hugging Face MCP tools to search and install them.

## Searching for Skills

Use the `hf_space_search` MCP tool to find skills:

```python
# Search for all skills
hf_space_search(filter="agent-skill")

# Search with keywords
hf_space_search(filter="agent-skill", search="training")
```

## Installing Skills

Use the `hf_download` MCP tool to download a skill:


```python
# Download a skill space
hf_download(repo_id="hf-skills/llm-trainer", repo_type="space", local_dir=".<agent_name>/skills/llm-trainer")
```

`<agent-name>` is the name of the agent you are installing the skill for. For example, for 'codex', the local_dir would be '.codex/skills/llm-trainer', and for 'claude', the local_dir would be '.claude/skills/llm-trainer'.

## Skill Structure

A valid skill contains a `SKILL.md` file with YAML front matter:

```markdown

name: my-skill-name
description: When to use this skill and what it does.

# Instructions for the agent...
```

Optional directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, `templates/`
